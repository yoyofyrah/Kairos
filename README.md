I needed faux-pixel are for a project and so I made a faux-pixel art converter. It turns regular pictures into pixel art in the browser and you can download them quick and easy.

Here's what it does:

Pixelation: You control how blocky the pixels get.
Output Size: Sets the final size of your art.
Color Count: Reduces the number of colors.
Palettes: You can generate a custom palette from your image (using a fancy K-means thing) or pick from preset old-school game palettes. There's even a random option for fun.
Dithering: This makes colors blend smoother, and you get to pick from a bunch of different algorithms and control their intensity.
Image Tweaks: Before it gets pixelated, you can mess with the original pic's hue, brightness, contrast, saturation, and gamma.
Save/Load Settings: Handy for saving your favorite setups.

To use it, just upload a picture and play with the sliders. Your pixel art shows up instantly, and you can download it as a PNG.
